# Conclusions and next steps

## Conclusions

* LFT has been at the forefront of many aspects of open science
  * Some areas suffer from first-mover disadvantage
* Opportunities remain to do more
  * Some low-hanging fruit
    * Specify software
    * Share existing code
  * Some require more effort
    * e.g. Automating analyses and presentation of data

-

## Next steps

* Produce a manifesto of good practice in open science in lattice
* Develop tooling to better enable automated analysis and presentation
  * Aspiration: "easier to use than not to"
* Informed by a survey of reproducible and open science practices
  * Next talk!
